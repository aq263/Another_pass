# ANOTHERpass

This Android app is another approach for a password manager.  Instead of managing user created passwords this app only allows to generate passwords in a special readable but secure manner. Another feature is a two factor authentification with knowledge (a user pin) and ownership (a master password physically stored as NFC tag or QR code).
