# ANOTHERpass

This Android app is another approach of a password manager. Instead of managing manually created passwords this app only allows to generate passwords in a special readable but secure manner. Another feature is a two factor authentication with knowledge (a user pin) and ownership (a master password physically stored as NFC tag or QR code).

The motivation for this app was curiosity of how encryption works, how to implement in Kotlin and the need of an easy, lightweight but secure password manager. It is a personal project without any warranty and pretension of absolute professionalism.
