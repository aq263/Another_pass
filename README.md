# ANOTHERpass

This Android app is another approach of a password manager. Instead of managing manually created passwords this app only allows to generate passwords in a special readable but secure manner. Another feature is a two factor authentification with knowledge (a user pin) and ownership (a master password physically stored as NFC tag or QR code).
