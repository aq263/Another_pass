<b>This is ANOTHER way to manage passwords!</b>

ANOTHERpass generates easy but strong passwords for you. It uses so called <i>Pseudo Phrases</i> by default which looks like real words but are still very random and unpredictable.

It also comes with a clever two factor authentication to login into the credential vault. These factors are knowledge (a PIN) and ownership (the master password). So instead of remembering a long and complicated master password you just remember the PIN and have your master password with you (as QR code or NFC tag). Additionally you can safely store it on your device using biometrics (e.g. fingerprint).

<b>Core features of the app</b>
