This offline password app manages generated strong passwords which are easy to type (but almost impossible to crack).

It also comes with a clever two factor authentication to login into your vault. These factors are knowledge (your pin) and ownership (the master password). So instead of remembering a long and complicated master password you just remember the pin and have your master password with you as QR code or NFC tag.
